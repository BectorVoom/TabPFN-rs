# Phase 1 - Burn 0.18.0 Tensor Operation Semantics Verification

This document contains verification results for key tensor operations used in MultiHeadAttention implementation.

## Overview

Target: Burn framework version 0.18.0
Backend: NdArray<f32> (CPU backend for verification)
Purpose: Ensure understanding of tensor operation semantics before implementing complex attention logic

## Verified Operations

### 1. Slice Operation

**Purpose**: Extract sub-tensors using range notation
**API**: `tensor.slice([start..end, ...])`

#### Test Cases & Results
- **Basic slice**: ✓ [0..1, 1..3, 0..2] on [2, 3, 4] → [1, 2, 2]
- **Multi-dimensional slice**: ✓ [0..2, 0..3, 2..4] on [2, 3, 4] → [2, 3, 2]  
- **Data preservation**: ✓ Sliced data matches expected values

#### Expected vs Observed
✅ **PASSED** - Slice operations work as expected with correct shape transformations and data preservation

### 2. Squeeze/Unsqueeze Operations

**Purpose**: Remove/add singleton dimensions
**API**: `tensor.squeeze::<DIM>()`, `tensor.unsqueeze_dim()`

#### Test Cases & Results
- **Basic squeeze**: ✓ [1, 3, 1, 4] → squeeze(0) → [3, 1, 4] → squeeze(1) → [3, 4]
- **Multi-dimensional unsqueeze**: ✓ [3, 4] → unsqueeze_dim(1) → [3, 1, 4] / unsqueeze_dim(0) → [1, 3, 4]
- **Type safety**: ✓ Compile-time dimension checking works correctly

#### Expected vs Observed
✅ **PASSED** - Squeeze/Unsqueeze operations work as expected with proper dimension manipulation

### 3. Repeat vs Expand Operations

**Purpose**: Tensor replication along dimensions  
**API**: `tensor.repeat(&[...])`, `tensor.expand()` (not available)

#### Test Cases & Results
- **Basic repeat**: ✓ [2, 1, 3] → repeat([1, 3, 1]) → [2, 3, 3]
- **Multi-dimensional repeat**: ✓ [2, 1, 3] → repeat([2, 2, 1]) → [4, 2, 3]
- **Expand availability**: ❌ `expand()` method not found in Burn 0.18.0

#### Expected vs Observed
✅ **PASSED** - Repeat operation works correctly. **CRITICAL FINDING**: `expand()` not available, must use `repeat()` with memory implications documented.

### 4. Reshape Operation

**Purpose**: Change tensor dimensions while preserving element count
**API**: `tensor.reshape([...])`

#### Test Cases & Results
- **Basic reshape**: ✓ [2, 3, 4] → [6, 4], [2, 12], [1, 24]
- **Element preservation**: ✓ 24 elements maintained across all transformations
- **Roundtrip reshape**: ✓ [2, 3, 4] → [1, 24] → [2, 3, 4]

#### Expected vs Observed
✅ **PASSED** - Reshape operations work as expected with proper element count preservation

### 5. Matrix Multiplication

**Purpose**: Tensor multiplication with broadcasting
**API**: `tensor.matmul(other)`

#### Test Cases & Results
- **2D matrix multiply**: ✓ [2, 2] × [2, 2] → [2, 2] with correct values
- **Batch matrix multiply**: ✓ [2, 2, 2] × [2, 2, 2] → [2, 2, 2]
- **Mathematical correctness**: ✓ Verified with manual calculations

#### Expected vs Observed
✅ **PASSED** - Matrix multiplication works correctly for both 2D and batch scenarios

### 6. Transpose/Swap Dimensions

**Purpose**: Reorder tensor dimensions
**API**: `tensor.swap_dims(dim1, dim2)`, `tensor.transpose()`

#### Test Cases & Results
- **Basic transpose**: ✓ [3, 5] → transpose() → [5, 3]
- **Multi-dimensional swap**: ✓ [2, 3, 4] → swap_dims(0, 1) → [3, 2, 4]
- **Different dimension pairs**: ✓ [2, 3, 4] → swap_dims(1, 2) → [2, 4, 3]

#### Expected vs Observed
✅ **PASSED** - Transpose/swap_dims operations work as expected across different tensor ranks

### 7. Softmax Activation

**Purpose**: Apply softmax activation along specified dimension
**API**: `activation::softmax(tensor, dim)`

#### Test Cases & Results
- **Different dimensions**: ✓ softmax(dim=0) and softmax(dim=1) work correctly
- **Numerical stability**: ✓ Sums equal 1.0 within 1e-6 tolerance
- **Multi-dimensional tensors**: ✓ [2, 3, 4] → softmax(dim=2) → [2, 3, 4]

#### Expected vs Observed
✅ **PASSED** - Softmax activation works correctly with proper probability distribution properties

### 8. Dropout Forward

**Purpose**: Apply dropout during training/inference
**API**: `Dropout::forward(tensor)`

#### Test Cases & Results
- **Shape preservation**: ✓ [100, 100] tensor maintains shape after dropout
- **Initialization**: ✓ `DropoutConfig::new(0.5).init()` works without device parameter
- **Stochastic behavior**: ✓ Different sums indicate dropout is working

#### Expected vs Observed
✅ **PASSED** - Dropout forward works as expected with proper API usage (no device parameter needed)

## Summary

**Verification Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Burn Version**: 0.18.0
**Test Date**: 2024-08-12
**All Tests Passed**: ✅ YES (8/8 tests passed)

### Key Findings
1. ✅ All basic tensor operations work as expected
2. ⚠️  **CRITICAL**: `expand()` method not available in Burn 0.18.0, must use `repeat()` instead
3. ✅ Shape transformations and mathematical operations behave correctly
4. ✅ Softmax maintains numerical stability and probability distribution properties
5. ✅ Dropout API works without device parameter (different from some other frameworks)

### Memory Optimization Notes
- Use `repeat()` judiciously due to actual memory allocation vs view-based `expand()`
- Document memory implications for broadcast operations in attention implementation
- Consider chunking strategies for large tensor operations

### Phase 1 Status
🎉 **Phase 1 PASSED — semantics verified**

*This verification ensures that all tensor operations behave as expected before implementing complex attention mechanisms.*
