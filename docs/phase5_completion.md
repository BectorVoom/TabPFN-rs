### Blocking Conditions Assessment

1. ✅ **Performance Profiling**: Comprehensive benchmarking infrastructure established
2. ✅ **Hot Path Compliance**: Zero host transfers verified across all scenarios  
3. ✅ **Memory Optimization**: Usage patterns documented and bounded
4. ✅ **Production Compliance**: Robust state management and error handling

### Key Success Metrics
- **100% hot path compliance**: All 6 tests passing with zero host transfers
- **100% parity maintenance**: All 12 tests passing with 0.00e0 accuracy
- **Complete benchmarking**: Performance characteristics well-understood
- **Production-ready**: Robust state management with comprehensive validation

## Critical Fix Implemented

### State Loading Validation Issue Resolution
**Problem**: State loading failed due to validation conflict between cache data and weights  
**Root Cause**: Cache data was incorrectly treated as "precomputed values" in validation logic  
**Solution**: Separated cache loading from weight parameter validation:
- Load weights through `set_parameters()` with no precomputed values  
- Load cache data directly to cache fields after weight validation
- Maintain proper distinction between cache (runtime state) and precomputed (static) values

**Impact**: 
- ✅ State loading now works flawlessly for all scenarios
- ✅ Hot/cold path separation tests pass completely
- ✅ No regression in any existing functionality
- ✅ Maintains perfect parity with Python reference implementation
