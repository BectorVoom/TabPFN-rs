- **Labels construction**: Proper -1 ignore pattern ✅  
- **Shape validation**: Comprehensive per-task validation ✅
- **Test Status**: Meta-batch tests now passing (previously expected to fail)

## Test Validation Results

### Core TDD Assertion Examples - All Passing ✅

```rust
// ✅ Tie-breaking determinism
assert_eq!(argmax_result, expected_smallest_indices);

// ✅ Loss finiteness  
assert!(loss.is_finite());

// ✅ Gradient clipping
assert!(grad_norm <= clip_threshold + eps);

// ✅ RNG reproducibility
assert_eq!(run_with_seed(42), run_with_seed(42));
```

### CI Evidence

#### Build Success ✅
```bash
cargo build -v
# Result: Compiled successfully with 22 warnings, 0 errors
# All warnings are unused imports/variables - no blocking issues
```

#### Test Results ✅
```bash
# Core argmax functionality
cargo test --test argmax_tie_tests test_tie_breaking_smallest_index
# Result: ✅ PASSED - "Tie-breaking verified - smallest index always wins"

# Loss computation
cargo test --test acceptance_criteria_tests test_b_mask_and_loss_ignore_index  
# Result: ✅ PASSED - "Loss=1.1536, finite and properly handles ignore_index"

# Meta-batch support  
cargo test --test tdd_meta_batch_fatal_fixes test_meta_batch_shape_validation_fails
# Result: ✅ PASSING (no longer fails as implementation is complete)
```

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Device Safety Compliance ✅
